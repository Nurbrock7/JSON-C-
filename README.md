# JSON-C-
JSON represents objects in structured text format and data stored in key-value pairs. Many third-party controls like Kendo UI grid supply data from client size to server-side in JSON string format so it is necessary to cast our JSON string to the appropriate object to access data.There are many ways for working with JSON in C# code.
